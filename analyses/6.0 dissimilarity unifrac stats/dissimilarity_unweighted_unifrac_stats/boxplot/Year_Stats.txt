# The tests of significance were performed using a two-sided Student's two-sample t-test.
# Alternative hypothesis: Group 1 mean != Group 2 mean
# The nonparametric p-values were calculated using 999 Monte Carlo permutations.
# The nonparametric p-values contain the correct number of significant digits.
# Entries marked with "N/A" could not be calculated because at least one of the groups
# of distances was empty, both groups each contained only a single distance, or
# the test could not be performed (e.g. no variance in groups with the same mean).
